• A small, elegant clutch in a metallic or neutral shade (silver, gold, ivory) to add a touch of sophistication.","• Consider a subtle smoky eye and nude lip to complement the outfit's delicate color palette and not overpower the look.  The makeup in the image is already very well done.
• Maintain the sleek, elegant hairstyle shown in the picture.  The long hair complements the outfit perfectly.",9/10 The outfit is stunning and appropriate for a special occasion. A slight adjustment to the accessories (as suggested above) would elevate it even further.

The dupatta could be a lighter, more flowing chiffon or net.","Opulent, Traditional Indian Bridal","• A matching maroon/burgundy clutch or potli bag to complement the outfit.
• While the jewelry is already extensive,  a statement maang tikka (forehead jewel) might add a further touch of elegance depending on the specific design of the existing jewelry.","• Ensure the embellishments and embroidery on the lehenga and dupatta don't overpower the overall look.  A careful balance is key for a sophisticated effect.
• Consider adding a small bindi (forehead dot) to complement the existing jewelry and makeup.  The color should coordinate with the overall color scheme.","9/10. The outfit is stunning and perfectly appropriate for a lavish party or wedding. The only slight deduction is for the potential for the extensive jewelry to be slightly overwhelming, depending on personal preference. A more minimalist choice of jewelry could potentially elevate the confidence score, but this is a matter of style and is not a flaw in the outfit itself."
